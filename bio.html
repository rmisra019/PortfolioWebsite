               Miyamoto was born in the Japanese town of Sonobe, a rural town northwest of Kyoto,[6] on November 16, 1952. His parents were
               of "modest means," and his father taught the English language.[6] From an early age, Miyamoto began to explore
               the natural areas around his home. On one of these expeditions, Miyamoto came upon a cave, and, after days of
               hesitation, went inside. Miyamoto's expeditions into the Kyoto countryside inspired his later work, particularly
               The Legend of Zelda, a seminal video game.[7] Miyamoto graduated from Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial
               Arts with a degree in industrial design[6] but no job lined up. He also had a love for manga and initially hoped
               to become a professional manga artist before considering a career in video games.[8] He was influenced by manga's
               classical kish≈çtenketsu narrative structure,[9] as well as Western genre television shows.[10] The title that
               inspired him to enter the video game industry was the 1978 arcade hit Space Invaders.[11]

               Miyamoto's games have received outstanding critical praise, and are widely considered among the greatest of all time.[6]
               Games in Miyamoto's The Legend of Zelda series have received outstanding critical acclaim. A Link to the Past
               was a landmark title for Nintendo and is widely considered today to be one of the greatest video games of all
               time. Ocarina of Time is widely considered by critics and gamers alike to be one of the greatest video games
               ever made.[63][64][65][66] Twilight Princess was released to universal critical acclaim, and is the third highest-rated
               title for the Wii.[67] It received perfect scores from major publications such as CVG, Electronic Gaming Monthly,
               Game Informer, GamesRadar, and GameSpy.[68][69][70][71][72] According to Metacritic, Super Mario Galaxy and Super
               Mario Galaxy 2 are the first- and second-highest rated games for the Wii.[67] A 1995 article in Maximum stated
               that "in gaming circles Miyamoto's name carries far more weight than Steven Spielberg's could ever sustain."[73]

               Miyamoto's philosophy does not focus on hyper-realistic graphics, although he realizes they have their place. He is more
               focused on the game mechanics, such as the choices and challenges in the game.[6] Similar to how manga artists
               subverted their genre, Miyamoto hopes to subvert some of the basic principles he had popularized in his early
               games, retaining some elements but eliminating others.[6] He prefers to change his games right until they are
               finalized, and to make "something unique and unprecedented", bearing cinematic qualities.[48][49]:5 However,
               he prefers the game to be interactively fun rather than have elaborate film sequences, stating in 1999, "I will
               never make movie-like games". For these reasons, he opposes prerendered cutscenes.[10][48] Miyamoto has stated
               that Donkey Kong and Super Mario Bros. were not intended to be childish games, and that he hopes his works appeal
               to a wide variety of different people. Part of Miyamoto's development philosophy is to make his games friendly
               to the player; for example, the ability to save and resume one's progress. He has said that finishing touches
               on a game can make a large difference on the final product.
