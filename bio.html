                        Miyamoto was born in the Japanese town of Sonobe, a rural town northwest of Kyoto,[6] on November 16, 1952. His parents were
                        of "modest means," and his father taught the English language.[6] From an early age, Miyamoto began to explore
                        the natural areas around his home. On one of these expeditions, Miyamoto came upon a cave, and, after days of
                        hesitation, went inside. Miyamoto's expeditions into the Kyoto countryside inspired his later work, particularly
                        The Legend of Zelda, a seminal video game.[7] Miyamoto graduated from Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial
                        Arts with a degree in industrial design[6] but no job lined up. He also had a love for manga and initially hoped
                        to become a professional manga artist before considering a career in video games.[8] He was influenced by manga's
                        classical kish≈çtenketsu narrative structure,[9] as well as Western genre television shows.[10] The title that
                        inspired him to enter the video game industry was the 1978 arcade hit Space Invaders.[11]

                        Miyamoto's games have received outstanding critical praise, and are widely considered among the greatest of all time.[6]
                        Games in Miyamoto's The Legend of Zelda series have received outstanding critical acclaim. A Link to the Past
                        was a landmark title for Nintendo and is widely considered today to be one of the greatest video games of all
                        time. Ocarina of Time is widely considered by critics and gamers alike to be one of the greatest video games
                        ever made.[63][64][65][66] Twilight Princess was released to universal critical acclaim, and is the third highest-rated
                        title for the Wii.[67] It received perfect scores from major publications such as CVG, Electronic Gaming Monthly,
                        Game Informer, GamesRadar, and GameSpy.[68][69][70][71][72] According to Metacritic, Super Mario Galaxy and Super
                        Mario Galaxy 2 are the first- and second-highest rated games for the Wii.[67] A 1995 article in Maximum stated
                        that "in gaming circles Miyamoto's name carries far more weight than Steven Spielberg's could ever sustain."[73]

                        Miyamoto's philosophy does not focus on hyper-realistic graphics, although he realizes they have their place. He is more
                        focused on the game mechanics, such as the choices and challenges in the game.[6] Similar to how manga artists
                        subverted their genre, Miyamoto hopes to subvert some of the basic principles he had popularized in his early
                        games, retaining some elements but eliminating others.[6] He prefers to change his games right until they are
                        finalized, and to make "something unique and unprecedented", bearing cinematic qualities.[48][49]:5 However,
                        he prefers the game to be interactively fun rather than have elaborate film sequences, stating in 1999, "I will
                        never make movie-like games". For these reasons, he opposes prerendered cutscenes.[10][48] Miyamoto has stated
                        that Donkey Kong and Super Mario Bros. were not intended to be childish games, and that he hopes his works appeal
                        to a wide variety of different people. Part of Miyamoto's development philosophy is to make his games friendly
                        to the player; for example, the ability to save and resume one's progress. He has said that finishing touches
                        on a game can make a large difference on the final product.

                        Time called Miyamoto "the Spielberg of video games"[50] and "the father of modern video games,"[11] while The Daily Telegraph says he is "regarded by many as possibly the most important game designer of all time."[51] GameTrailers called him "the most influential game creator in history."[52] Miyamoto has significantly influenced various aspects of the medium. The Daily Telegraph credited him with creating "some of the most innovative, ground breaking and successful work in his field."[51] Many of Miyamoto's works have pioneered new video game concepts or refined existing ones. Miyamoto's games have received outstanding critical praise, some being considered the greatest games of all time.
                        Miyamoto's games have also sold very well, becoming some of the best-selling games on Nintendo consoles and of all time. As of 1999, his games had sold 250 million units and grossed billions of dollars.[51]
                        Calling him one of the few "video-game auteurs," The New Yorker credited Miyamoto's role in creating the franchises that drove console sales, as well as designing the consoles themselves. They described Miyamoto as Nintendo's "guiding spirit, its meal ticket, and its playful public face," noting that Nintendo might not exist without him.[6] The Daily Telegraph similarly attributed Nintendo's success to Miyamoto more than any other person.[51] Next Generation listed him in their "75 Most Important People in the Games Industry of 1995", elaborating that, "He's the most successful game developer in history. He has a unique and brilliant mind as well as an unparalleled grasp of what gamers want to play."[53]
